# Introduction
The aim of this assignment is to convent a car loan calculator by writing a JAVA program to solve this problem. In this assignment, I create the formula of monthly repayment, principal, interest and balance. Before we start to write a Java program to solve this problem, we have to write a pseudocode and draw a flow chart to find the way to solve the problem. When we are coding, I have used `do...while` statement as a method. This method is used to check the condition whether can be satisfied or not. If the condition cannot be satisfied, the user is required to enter the input again until the user entered the proper value which the condition is met. Then, it can proceed to the next input.
