# Introduction
The aim of this assignment is to use a car loan calculator as the input and to make a car loan table by writing a Java program to solve this problem. To calculate the car loan payment, the elements required are car price, down payment, loan period and interest rate. Before a user have to write a Java program, the user have to write a pseudocode and draw a flow chart first to solve the problem. When the user are coding, the user created the formula for monthly repayment, total loan payment, principal, interest and balance. The user is also used `do...while` statement as a method. This method is used to check the additional requirements whether can be satisfied or not. If the additional requirements cannot be satisfied, the user is required to enter the input again until the user enters the proper value in which the condition is met. Then, the program can proceed to the next input. After all the inputs are set, the program will display the amount of monthly repayment and a car loan table according to the loan period.
